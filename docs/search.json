    "text": "- Lec: Conceptual introduction to computational chemistry\n- Lab: IQMOL, exploring potential energy surfaces with IQMOL\nComputational chemistry is a field in which computational approaches are used to tackle chemical problems. These computational approaches allow us to rationalise experimental observations, predict reaction outcomes and design improved chemical reagents, catalysts and materials. The most powerful computational approaches involve supercomputers which allow the field to dive into areas of study such as quantum chemistry, molecular mechanics and also use machine learning to approach these same chemical problems.\nComputational chemistry can be used to perform calculations such as:\n- Atomic and molecular structure and energies (electronic, vibrational, rotational) of ground and excited states (spectra).\n- Thermodynamic properties and rate coefficients and equilibrium constants.\n- Dynamics (radial distribution functions and lifetimes)\n- Molecular properties such as molecular orbitals, atomic charges and electrostatic potential surfaces.\nA potential energy surface describes how the potential energy of a molecular changes with nuclear coordinates.\nCan derive a description of molecular orbitals by solving the time-independent S.E which requires the use of basis functions (basis sets).\nA basis set is a set of functions (basis functions) that are used to represent the electronic wave function within the Hartree-Fock method or density-functional theory, this allows the transformation of the partial differential equations within the model into algebraic equations that are more easily solvable via computational methods. Orbitals are expanded within the basis set as a linear combination of the basis functions. Most commonly the basis set is composed of atomic orbitals and this is referred to as the linear combination of atomic orbitals approach.\nSeveral types of atomic orbitals are often used: Gaussian-type orbitals, Slater-type orbitals or numerical atomic orbitals. Out of these options, Gaussian-type orbitals are most commonly used as they are less computationally demanding.\nWithin the basis set, the wavefunction is represented using a vector, the components of this vector correspond to the coefficients of the basis functions within the linear expansion.\nWhen performing molecular calculations, the common approach is to use a basis composed to atomic orbitals that are centered at each nucleus within a molecule.\nThe most physically reasonable basis set is the Slater-type orbitals, these are solutions to the Schrodinger equation of hydrogen like atoms.\n- Decay exponentially far away from the nucleus.\n- Satisfies Kato’s cusp condition at the nucleus, meaning that they are able to accurately describe electron density near the nucleus.\nAn issue that arises from the use of hydrogen like atoms is that these atoms lack ‘many-electron’ interactions and correspondingly their orbitals also lack the ability to represent these interactions (electron state correlations).\nWhilst Slater-type orbitals are the most physically reasonable basis set, calculating integrals with this set is very computationally challenging and thus a new approach was required. Using linear combinations of Gaussian-type orbitals to approximate a Slater-type orbital leads to substantial computational savings. The savings associated with this alternative process arise from the fact that when using the linear combination of Gaussian-type orbitals, integrals with Gaussian basis functions can be written in a closed form. (what does this mean?).\nThere exists a large library of basis sets, these sets typically are arranged in a hierarchy of increasing size. A larger basis set allows for the derivation of more accurate solutions however this comes with a increasingly large computational cost.\nMinimal basis sets are the smallest of the basis sets. Each atom in a molecule has a single basis function used for each orbital in a Hartree-Fock calculation on the free atom.\nPolarisation functions: additional functions that are added to the set to describe the polarisation of electron density of an atom within molecules. This addition allows for more flexibility of the basis set, which in turn allows the molecular orbitals to be more asymmetric about the nucleus. These functions are important for chemical bonding because bonds are often polarised.\nDiffuse functions:\n- Extended Gaussian functions with a small exponent that gives flexibility to the tail portion of the atomic orbitals distal from the nucleus.\n- These diffuse basis functions are important when considering anions or dipole moments and additionally can be important for the accurate modeling of intra and inter molecular bonding.\nSplit-valence basis sets:\n- Most commonly during molecular bonding, it is the valence electrons that are principally participating in the bonding. Thus representing these valence orbitals with more than one basis function is a common approach. The nomenclature for these split basis sets are double, triple, quadruple zeta etc basis sets. As the varying orbitals within the split basis sets have different spatial extents, it provides the set with the flexibility to adjust its electron density appropriately for a given molecular environment. This is an improvement relative to minimal basis sets who lack the flexibility to adjust to these particular molecular environments."

    "title": "Simple Linear Regression",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Note: Information in this article is derived from the book ‘Practical Statistics for Data Scientists’.\nSimple linear regression can be used to derive a model of the relationship present between the magnitude of one variable and that of another.\nThe dataset below contains records of the numbers of years a given worker has been exposed to cotton dust (‘Exposure’) versus a metric used to describe ones lung capacity (peak expiratory flow rate, ‘PEFR’).\nFrom this graph it is hard to judge the relationship between these two variables by eye, especially if one was intending to make a prediction from the association of the two variables.\n\nlung = pd.read_csv('LungDisease.csv')\nsns.scatterplot(data=lung, x='Exposure',y='PEFR')\n\n<AxesSubplot:xlabel='Exposure', ylabel='PEFR'>\n\n\n\n\n\nIf one did intend to make a prediction regarding the lung capacity of a worker after some defined period of exposure, a linear regression model would be appropriate.\nSimple linear regression provides an estimate of how much the response variable, Y will change when the predictor variable, X changes by a specified amount. This regression relationship is given by:\n\\(Y=b_0+b_1X\\)\nWhere;\n\\(b_0\\) = Intercept\n\\(b_1\\) = Slope\n\npredictors = ['Exposure']\noutcome = 'PEFR'\nlm = LinearRegression()\nlm.fit(lung[predictors], lung[outcome])\nprint(f'Intercept: {lm.intercept_:.3f}')\nprint(f'Coefficient Exposure: {lm.coef_[0]:.3f}')\n\nIntercept: 424.583\nCoefficient Exposure: -4.185\n\n\nThe intercept can be interpreted in this context as the predicted lung capacity or ‘PEFR’ of a worker who has had zero years of exposure to cotton dust. The regression coefficient or slope can be interpreted as the change in lung capacity for each year of exposure to cotton dust.\nSo it can be seen that a worker who has yet to be exposed to cotton dust is predicted to have a PEFR value of 424.583 and for every year of exposure to cotton dust that value is expected to decrease by 4.185.\n\nsns.regplot(data=lung,x='Exposure', y='PEFR')\n\n<AxesSubplot:xlabel='Exposure', ylabel='PEFR'>\n\n\n\n\n\nThe regression line is the plot above indicates the ‘fitted values’ or the predictions derived from the linear regression model. It can be seen that generally the data doesn’t fall exactly on the regression line and this deviation can be quantified as the ‘residuals’.\nThis concept of residual values underlines the manner in which our linear model is fit to the data set. The regression line itself is defined as the estimate that minimises the sum of the squared residual values, this is known as the residual sum of squares (RSS). This method of minimising the RSS is also referred to as least squares regression or ordinary least squares regression.\nRegression analysis is primarily used to bring light to a supposed linear relationship between a set of predictor variables and a response variable. Our primary goal is to understand this association and explain it using the data one has. In the case of this dataset is can be seen that exposure to cotton dust has a deleterious effect on the lung capacity of workers and predictions of this effect can be quantified using the derived regression coefficient (\\(\\hat{b}\\)).\nReferences:\nBruce, Peter, Andrew Bruce, and Peter Gedeck.
