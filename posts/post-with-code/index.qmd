Computational chemistry is a field in which computational approaches are used to tackle chemical problems. These computational approaches allow us to rationalise experimental observations, predict reaction outcomes and design improved chemical reagents, catalysts and materials. The most powerful computational approaches involve supercomputers which allow the field to dive into areas of study such as quantum chemistry, molecular mechanics and also use machine learning to approach these same chemical problems.

Computational chemistry can be used to perform calculations such as:

\- Atomic and molecular structure and energies (electronic, vibrational, rotational) of ground and excited states (spectra).

\- Thermodynamic properties and rate coefficients and equilibrium constants.

\- Dynamics (radial distribution functions and lifetimes)

\- Molecular properties such as molecular orbitals, atomic charges and electrostatic potential surfaces.

A potential energy surface describes how the potential energy of a molecular changes with nuclear coordinates.

Can derive a description of molecular orbitals by solving the time-independent S.E which requires the use of basis functions (basis sets).

A basis set is a set of functions (basis functions) that are used to represent the electronic wave function within the Hartree-Fock method or density-functional theory, this allows the transformation of the partial differential equations within the model into algebraic equations that are more easily solvable via computational methods. Orbitals are expanded within the basis set as a linear combination of the basis functions. Most commonly the basis set is composed of atomic orbitals and this is referred to as the linear combination of atomic orbitals approach.

Several types of atomic orbitals are often used: Gaussian-type orbitals, Slater-type orbitals or numerical atomic orbitals. Out of these options, Gaussian-type orbitals are most commonly used as they are less computationally demanding.

Within the basis set, the wavefunction is represented using a vector, the components of this vector correspond to the coefficients of the basis functions within the linear expansion.

When performing molecular calculations, the common approach is to use a basis composed to atomic orbitals that are centered at each nucleus within a molecule.

The most physically reasonable basis set is the Slater-type orbitals, these are solutions to the Schrodinger equation of hydrogen like atoms.

\- Decay exponentially far away from the nucleus.

\- Satisfies Kato's cusp condition at the nucleus, meaning that they are able to accurately describe electron density near the nucleus.

An issue that arises from the use of hydrogen like atoms is that these atoms lack 'many-electron' interactions and correspondingly their orbitals also lack the ability to represent these interactions (electron state correlations).

Whilst Slater-type orbitals are the most physically reasonable basis set, calculating integrals with this set is very computationally challenging and thus a new approach was required. Using linear combinations of Gaussian-type orbitals to approximate a Slater-type orbital leads to substantial computational savings. The savings associated with this alternative process arise from the fact that when using the linear combination of Gaussian-type orbitals, integrals with Gaussian basis functions can be written in a closed form. (what does this mean?).

There exists a large library of basis sets, these sets typically are arranged in a hierarchy of increasing size. A larger basis set allows for the derivation of more accurate solutions however this comes with a increasingly large computational cost.

Minimal basis sets are the smallest of the basis sets. Each atom in a molecule has a single basis function used for each orbital in a Hartree-Fock calculation on the free atom.

Polarisation functions: additional functions that are added to the set to describe the polarisation of electron density of an atom within molecules. This addition allows for more flexibility of the basis set, which in turn allows the molecular orbitals to be more asymmetric about the nucleus. These functions are important for chemical bonding because bonds are often polarised.

Diffuse functions:

\- Extended Gaussian functions with a small exponent that gives flexibility to the tail portion of the atomic orbitals distal from the nucleus.

\- These diffuse basis functions are important when considering anions or dipole moments and additionally can be important for the accurate modeling of intra and inter molecular bonding.

Split-valence basis sets:

\- Most commonly during molecular bonding, it is the valence electrons that are principally participating in the bonding. Thus representing these valence orbitals with more than one basis function is a common approach. The nomenclature for these split basis sets are double, triple, quadruple zeta etc basis sets. As the varying orbitals within the split basis sets have different spatial extents, it provides the set with the flexibility to adjust its electron density appropriately for a given molecular environment. This is an improvement relative to minimal basis sets who lack the flexibility to adjust to these particular molecular environments.

## Terms

\- Radial distribution function: Within a system of particles (atoms, molecules) describes how density varies as a function of distance from a reference particle. \[Reference\](https://chem.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Biological_Chemistry/Concepts_in_Biophysical_Chemistry\_(Tokmakoff)/01%3A_Water_and_Aqueous_Solutions/01%3A_Fluids/1.02%3A_Radial_Distribution_Function)

\- Electron correlation: the interactions between electrons within the electronic structure of a quantum system. The correlation energy is a measure of how much the movement of a given electron is influenced by the presence of all other electrons within the system.
